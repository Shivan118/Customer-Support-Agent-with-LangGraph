# Customer Support Agent Query Processing

## Problem Statement

In customer support and query resolution, it is crucial to efficiently classify and handle queries based on their nature. Manual query processing is time-consuming and inefficient. We need an automated workflow that:

- Categorizes incoming queries.
- Analyzes their sentiment.
- Routes them to the correct department (Technical, Billing, General).
- Escalates if necessary.
- Concludes successfully after processing.

## âœ… Solution Approach

We implement a state-based workflow using a langGraph, ensuring queries pass through well-defined steps:

1. **Categorization:** Identify the type of query.
2. **Sentiment Analysis:** Assess sentiment to determine urgency.
3. **Routing:** Direct the query to the appropriate handling unit.
4. **Handling:** Process the query as per category.
5. **Escalation (if needed):** If unresolved, escalate the query.
6. **End the process** after handling.
